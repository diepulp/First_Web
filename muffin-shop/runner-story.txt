Local Woman Wins with Muffins

Auburn native Winnie Marston won the 27th Race to the Sea Marathon.  Winnie credited her win with a great training program and a reliance on the healthy, protein fiber muffin she gets every day from the Muffin Shop. Laura won over an elite field of the best long-distance runners in the country. Winnie's victory came on the heels of her performance at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Green River College.

The Muffin Shop proudly sponsors Winnie's training breakfasts. We love you Winnie!  You go girl!

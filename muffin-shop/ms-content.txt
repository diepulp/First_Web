Recipe
Cinnamon Muffins  
Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Instructions
Preheat the oven to 375ºF. Grease 16 muffins cups.
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt.
In another bowl, beat together the milk, vegetable oil, and eggs. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients. Stir just until combined – don’t overmix.
Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared muffin cups.
In a small bowl, combine the 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture over the tops of the batter filled cups.

Bake the muffins until a toothpick instead in the center comes out clean, 13-15 minutes.
